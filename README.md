# Multithreading Experiments

This repository contains various experiments and sample code to demonstrate multithreading concepts in programming. The goal is to provide examples that help understand how concurrent execution works, common patterns, synchronization mechanisms, and performance considerations when working with threads.

## Overview

Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently, potentially improving the efficiency and responsiveness of applications. This repository is intended for learning, testing, and benchmarking different multithreading techniques.

## Features

- Sample code demonstrating thread creation and management
- Synchronization primitives: mutexes, locks, semaphores, etc.
- Experiments with race conditions and deadlocks
- Performance benchmarks and analysis
- Examples in multiple programming languages (if applicable)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naman-sriv/multithreading_experiments.git
cd multithreading_experiments
```

Ensure you have a compatible compiler/interpreter for the language(s) used. See the directory structure for language-specific instructions.

## Directory Structure

- Each subdirectory contains a related experiment or example.
- Benchmarks and analysis scripts can be found in `benchmarks/`.


## Experiments

- **Basic Threading**: Creating and managing threads
- **Synchronization**: Using locks and semaphores
- **Race Conditions**: Demonstrating data races
- **Deadlocks**: Examples and avoidance techniques
- **Performance**: Measuring speedup and overhead
